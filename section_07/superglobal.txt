In PHP, superglobals are predefined variables that are always accessible, regardless of scope, meaning you can access them from any function, class, or file without needing to do anything special. 
These superglobals are associative arrays that contain information such as form data, server details, session data, and more.

List of PHP Superglobals:
$_GLOBALS
$_SERVER
$_GET
$_POST
$_FILES
$_COOKIE
$_SESSION
$_REQUEST
$_ENV

1. $_GLOBALS
Description: An associative array containing references to all variables currently defined in the global scope of the script.
Usage: Useful for accessing global variables from anywhere in the PHP script.

2. $_SERVER
Description: An array containing information such as headers, paths, and script locations. It's one of the most commonly used superglobals.
Usage: Commonly used to get information about the request, server, and execution environment.

3. $_GET
Description: An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters (query string).
Usage: Typically used to collect form data after submitting a form with the "get" method or to get values passed in the URL.

4. $_POST
Description: An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method.
Usage: Commonly used to collect form data after submitting a form with the "post" method.

5. $_FILES
Description: An associative array of items uploaded to the current script via the HTTP POST method. This superglobal is used to handle file uploads.
Usage: Used to get information about files uploaded via a form.

6. $_COOKIE
Description: An associative array of variables passed to the current script via HTTP Cookies.
Usage: Used to retrieve cookie values sent by the client.

7. $_SESSION
Description: An associative array containing session variables available to the current script. 
            Sessions are used to store information across multiple pages.
Usage: Used to manage user sessions, typically for maintaining user login states.

8. $_REQUEST
Description: An associative array that contains the contents of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE.
Usage: Used to collect data sent by GET, POST, or COOKIE. 
      Note that using $_REQUEST can sometimes be less secure than using $_GET or $_POST directly because it mixes all input methods.

9.$_ENV
Description: An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the environment method. 
            These variables are often provided by the server and can include information like the system path.
Usage: Used to access environment variables, which are often set outside of the PHP script.
